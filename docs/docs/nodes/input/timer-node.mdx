# Timer Node

The **Timer Node** triggers workflow execution at a specified interval. Use it to schedule periodic actions, automate polling, or kick off workflows on a timer.

## Configuration

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="interval" label="Interval Mode" default>
    **Interval Mode** triggers the node at a fixed interval (in seconds).  
    - `Interval(s)` (number): field to specify how often the node should trigger.
    - `Run once` (boolean): option to trigger only a single time.
    - `Trigger immediately, then repeat` (boolean): option to run once as soon as the timer starts.

    ![Timer Node Interval](/img/nodes/timer-node-params-interval.webp)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="scheduled" label="Scheduled Mode">
    **Scheduled Mode** triggers the node at a specific date and time, with optional repeat settings.
    - `Scheduled Date & Time` (datetime): field to choose when the node should trigger.
    - `Repeat` (string): set to "Once", "Daily", "Weekly", or "Monthly" for recurring triggers.

## Example Usage

For example usage, see the [Timeseries Chart workflow](/docs/workflows/data/timeseries-chart), which demonstrates using the Timer Node to fetch data at regular intervals.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Scheduled API Calls**: Fetch data from an API every minute.
2. **Automated Monitoring**: Check for changes or updates on a schedule.
3. **Periodic Processing**: Run batch jobs or data transformations at intervals.

## Best Practices

- **Set a reasonable interval**: Avoid very short intervals to reduce resource usage.
- **Combine with other nodes**: Use with Get Data, AI Processing, or Output nodes for automation.
- **Monitor workflow activity**: Use Data Flow Spy nodes to inspect outputs.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Node not triggering**: For Interval mode, ensure the interval is set and the node is running. For Scheduled mode, check that the scheduled date/time is in the future and the node is enabled.
- **Too frequent triggers**: Increase the interval value.
- **Workflow not starting**: Check downstream node configuration and connections.

### Performance Tips

- Use longer intervals for heavy or resource-intensive workflows.
- Avoid overlapping triggers by ensuring downstream nodes complete before the next interval.
