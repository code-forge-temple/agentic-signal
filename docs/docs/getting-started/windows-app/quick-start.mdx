# Quick Start

If you **do not want to develop or build from source**, you can simply:

1. **Download the release package** for your operating system from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/code-forge-temple/agentic-signal/releases).
2. **Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)** (required for web scraping and browser automation nodes).
3. **Install and Start `Agentic Signal`**  
   - Run the installer you downloaded from GitHub Releases and follow the prompts to complete installation.
   - **Windows users:** When launching `Agentic Signal` for the first time, your antivirus may scan the app because the installer is unsigned.  
    > If you notice the app is slow or unresponsive, wait for the scan to finish, then close `Agentic Signal` and restart it. This resolves most issues related to initial antivirus checks.
   - **macOS users:** If you see an "app is damaged" error, run this command in Terminal to remove quarantine attributes:
    ```bash
    xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Agentic\ Signal.app
    ```
    > This error occurs because the app is unsigned. The command removes macOS Gatekeeper's quarantine flag, allowing the app to run normally.
4. **Configure Ollama and App Settings:**  
   See [Ollama and App Configuration](../configuration) for instructions on:
     - Setting up Ollama CORS for the Windows app
     - Configuring the Ollama Host and Chrome Executable Path in the app settings
5. *(Optional)* **Set up Google OAuth2 Client for Google integrations:**  
   If you want to use Gmail, Google Drive, or Google Calendar nodes, follow the [Google OAuth2 Client Setup](../google-oauth-client) guide to create your credentials in Google Cloud Console.  
6. *(Optional)* **Set up Reddit OAuth2 Client for Reddit integrations:**  
   If you want to use the Reddit nodes / tools (available only in <a href='https://pricing.agentic-signal.com/'><span className="pro-badge">PRO</span> subscription tier</a>), follow the [Reddit OAuth2 Client Setup](../reddit-oauth-client) guide to create your credentials in Reddit Developer Portal.  


You are now ready to use `Agentic Signal` with local AI and browser automation!
