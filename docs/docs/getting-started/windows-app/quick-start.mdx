# Quick Start

If you **do not want to develop or build from source**, you can simply:

1. **Download the release package** for your operating system from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/code-forge-temple/agentic-signal/releases).
2. **Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)** (required for web scraping and browser automation nodes).
3. **Start `Agentic Signal`** by running the downloaded app.
4. **Configure Ollama and App Settings:**  
   See [Ollama and App Configuration](../configuration) for instructions on:
     - Setting up Ollama CORS for the Windows app
     - Configuring the Ollama Host and Chrome Executable Path in the app settings

You are now ready to use `Agentic Signal` with local AI and browser automation!
